## How to set things up

1. Once you've deployed to the new environment from staging, and assuming you have Service Center or Lifetime access, you'll need to configure users and start the necessary timers.
2. In the CMOS_User_CS module, run the timer. This will generate a new user account for system access.
This action is the sole requirement for system access.
